# Restaurant Website Design Brainstorm

## Design Approach 1: Minimalist Elegance (Probability: 0.08)

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Minimalism with Luxury Undertones

**Core Principles:**
- Extreme whitespace and breathing room between elements
- Monochromatic base with single accent color (deep burgundy or forest green)
- Typography-driven hierarchy with generous font sizes
- Asymmetric layouts that guide the eye naturally

**Color Philosophy:**
- Off-white/cream backgrounds (not pure white) to reduce eye strain
- Deep burgundy (#5C2E3A) or forest green (#1B4D3E) as primary accent
- Soft grays for secondary text and borders
- Gold accents for premium touches

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Left-aligned asymmetric sections with right-side whitespace
- Full-width hero with minimal text overlay
- Staggered card layouts for menu items and testimonials
- Generous vertical spacing (8rem+ between sections)

**Signature Elements:**
- Thin horizontal lines as visual separators
- Large serif typography for headings
- Subtle drop shadows on cards
- Elegant dividers between sections

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth, slow transitions (300-500ms)
- Hover states that reveal additional information
- Subtle scale transforms on interactive elements
- Fade-in animations as user scrolls

**Animation:**
- Entrance animations: fade-in with slight upward movement
- Hover effects: gentle scale (1.02x) and shadow depth increase
- Scroll animations: parallax on hero background
- Transitions: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for smooth motion

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif) for headings
- Body: Lato or Poppins for readable body text
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem (h1) → 2.5rem (h2) → 1.5rem (h3) → 1rem (body)

- Diagonal cuts and angled sections
- Multi-column layouts with varied widths
- Floating elements and layered compositions

**Signature Elements:**
- Textured overlays on images
- Decorative food illustrations
- Bold typography overlays on images
- Geometric shapes as design accents

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Playful, responsive interactions
- Hover states that reveal hidden content
- Click-triggered animations and reveals
- Staggered animations for multiple elements

**Animation:**
- Entrance: staggered fade-in with rotation
- Hover: 3D transforms and depth shifts
- Scroll: elements animate in from different directions
- Transitions: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) for bouncy motion

**Typography System:**
- Display: Bebas Neue or Montserrat Bold for dramatic headings
- Body: Roboto or Open Sans for clarity
- Hierarchy: 4rem (h1) → 2.8rem (h2) → 1.8rem (h3) → 1rem (body)
